Rainbows in Africa
Shine in the night ;
lumined by stars 
millions of light years far
a dancing shimmer 
on beings ebony and smooth 
neither red neither
orange
neither
yellow nor
green,
or even 
blue
no
indigo
No
violet
but a dance exotic an wild 
a dance of colours strange and blind,
that dance 
in all bleeding hearts
